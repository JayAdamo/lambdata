At least 2 things to compliment and at least 1 constructive criticism

Compliment: Liked the simplicity of the code in the helper_function.py. The ideal scenario is to have the simplest code which achieves the objectives. Excellent work on that.

Compliment: Consistent explanation of what the two functions do inside the triple quotes. Any subsequent user will be able to fully and clearly understand what each function does before delving into the actual code.

Compliment: The concept of classes and objects is often very elusive and often difficult to understand. A clear explanation of the creation of your 'Park' class which instantiates (represents by an instance) 'Park' objects. 

Potential Area of Development:  Repetition of '''
1) A function to find missing values in a dataframe
'''    at the beginning of helper_function.py

Overall: Simplicity is the ultimate sophistication. Very simple code which achieves the intended results. Any user, even non techincal users will be able to follow through. Good work, keep it up.
